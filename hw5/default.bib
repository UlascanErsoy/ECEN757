abstract = {Scalable data warehouses, as a desired solution to some of the problems introduced in the previous chapter, have specific architectural dimensions that are explained in this chapter, including workload, data complexity, query complexity, availability and data latency. This chapter introduces the architecture of a Data Vault-based data warehouse, including the stage, data warehouse, and information mart layers. In addition, it shows how to use a business vault and other components of the proposed architecture.}
